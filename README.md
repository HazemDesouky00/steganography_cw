This code works on hiding a message inputted from the user inside an image also selected by the user.
The user can also extract their message by mathching it to a password they need to set up in the beginning of the code.
Program focuses on converting the message taken from user from ASCII to binary and then insert the binary into the least significant bit in the image.

Steps:
User gets asked by the program to insert an image path in BMP format 
User is then asked to set a strong password that meets a set of requirements such as (minimum of 8 characters, Use of special characters, Use of capital letters, Use of numbers)
After that, the user is finally allowed to enter their message to be secretly embedded in the image path they've entered 
The program proceeds to ask the user in the next step for the password.
If the password matches. User is able to see the hidden message.
If the password does not match, the user has 3 attempts to write down the correct password, once all attempts are done the user gets blocked and won't be able to view the message
